# Who is building dEiRA?

dEiRA started in 20122 and is being built by a team behind dEiRA Labs LLC.

- We are a 4-person engineering and creative team with an inherent passion for borderless fintech and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

- While the team has been involved in various SaaS ventures and fintech since 2013, it transitioned to the cryptocurrency and fintech domain full-time in 2022.

- The transition to crypto was a result of experiencing limited problems when dealing with traditional finance on a business as well as individual levels.

- The idea of building a decentralized asset storage and management instrument outside the reach of traditional finance was too hard to resist.
